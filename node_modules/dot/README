Created in search of the fast and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs.

	doT can be used with nodejs and other javascript environments.

	doT.js is a blend of jQote2 and underscore.js templating functions with some additions.

	jQote2 technique provides for fast performance and also enables flushing data to the stream at any point in the generated template function, this is handy when using on server.

Features:
		custom delimiters,
		runtime evaluation,
		runtime interpolation,
		compile-time evaluation,
		encoding,
		control whitespace - strip or preserve,
		streaming friendly

Usage:
	Default delimiters:
		{{= }} for interpolation,
		{{  }} for evaluation,
		{{! }} for interpolation with encoding,
		{{# }} for compile-time evaluation/includes,
		{{## #}} for compile-time defines

	Other delimiters may be configured.

	To control whitespace use 'strip' option, true - to strip, false - to preserve.

	Sample:
	// 1. Compile template function
	var tempFn = doT.template("<h1>Here is a sample template {{=it.foo}} </h1>");
	// 2. Use template function as many times as you like
	var resultText = tempFn({foo: 'with doT'});
